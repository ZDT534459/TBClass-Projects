<h3>Biggums bbq</h3>

<p>So to start us off, I'm going with BBQ, mainly because of how often I crave it.<br>
Biggums BBQ happens to be a family favorite for me, especially due to it being such a rare treat.<br>
Each year I go up into Ellijay with my grandparents to purchase apples and other delicious treats from a particular<br>
orchard store, and when lunch comes around my folks always seem to find their way to biggums.<br>
My personal favorite there, are the ribs. A full rack with a few extra sides is more than enough to fill all three of us up.</p>

<p><b>Rating between a 4/5 (Mainly due to how long and cramped the lines are!)</b></p>

<h3>Cookout</h3>
<a href="https://cookout.com/" target="_blank"> <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/logopedia/images/8/8f/Cookout.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20171208042132" alt="Cookout" style="width:30%;height:20%;border:0;"> </a>

<p>Whenever I happen to be in the mood for a burger, and find myself with some extra pocket change, you can count<br>
on Cookout to be a great place to visit for a fullfilling burger/fries/side/and drink, all for around 4-5$!<br>
My personal favorite there aside from the burgers of course, are their corndogs, nothing taste better than a mustard slathered corndog!<br>
Just like at the georgia fairgrounds!</p>

<p><b>Between a 4/5 (Mainly due to them not having my favorite watermelon flavored milkshake year round!)</b></p>

<h3>Hibachi Shop</h3>
<a href="https://www.seamless.com/menu/hibachi-stop-2856-delk-rd-ste-305-marietta/400988?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=place-action-link" target="_blank"> <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/grubhub/image/upload/w_1200,h_800,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_80,c_fit/kzq2ydgbrhf41ifiwfvb" alt="HibachiG" style="width:20%;height:30%;border:0;"> </a>

<p>If you're in the mood for a filling piece of tai, or just looking for something flavorfull, I recommend this place.<br>
It has a wide variety of goods, ranging from just plain udon noodles with stir fried rice, to my personal favorite, takoyaki!<br>
A yummy mushy ball of bread, beef, and chewy squid in the center!<br>
All complimented with a tasty combo of thousand island sauce and mayo along the top.</p>

<p><b>Personal rating, a 5/5 (Mainly due to it being the first time I had Takoyaki!)</b></p>

<h3>Marietta Fish Market</h3>
<a href="http://mariettafishmarket.net/" target="_blank"> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSCwkQAWJMFsKx035fsDpr-87AaXol9_z7NdKMVOLF3-Iy1Kql-0Q" alt="Biggumsbbq" style="width:15%;height:30%;border:0;"> </a>

<p>This place is a personal family favorite as well, going as our #1 choice for birthday dinners.<br>
Especially since they offer you a free slice of New York Styled Cheesecake for free on your b-day!<br>
My favorite dish has to be the Salmon crab patties, slathered in white sauce and complimented with a mixed<br>
variety of seafood chowder on the side. Never in my life have I ever tasted such a new flavor<br>
and the ambiance is quite lovely to admire as well with the giant fish tank taking up the spotlight as well.</p>

<p><b>Between a 4/5 (Mainly because their booths are a bit hard for me to get in and out of due to the grooves blocking us)</b></p>

<h3>Doucher de France</h3>
<a href="http://www.douceurdefrance.com/" target="_blank"> <img src="https://orig00.deviantart.net/2d7d/f/2018/302/4/5/doucherdefrancelogo_by_azelferestda-dcqnmcr.png" alt="DoucherdeFrance" style="width:35%;height:20%;border:0;"> </a>

<p>Now comes my favorite part, the dessert! Fish market can only offer you cake, while this place offers you<br>
a straight up sweet tooth buffet! Beignets, macadamia cookies, creamhorns, you name it, they probably have it.<br>
One of my favorite things to buy there are the Macarons. I simply LOVE macarons. Such a sweet crunchy shell of thin<br>
proportions, all squished together around a tastey filling. I cannot think of a better snack/dessert<br>
than a Macha green tea macaron on a spring afternoon in the woods.<br>
Truely an experience of inner peace to behold.</p>

<p>A pure 5/5!</p>
